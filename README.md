Subject: Proposal for Collaboration on Recycling Super Absorbent Polymer (SAP) from Diapers in India

Dear [TerraCycle Contact Name],

I hope this message finds you well.

My name is [Your Name], and I am an individual entrepreneur based in India with a passion for sustainability and waste management. I am reaching out to TerraCycle with an idea that I believe could align with your global mission of eliminating waste and promoting recycling.

I’ve been exploring the environmental impact of disposable diapers, particularly the Super Absorbent Polymer (SAP) used in the absorbent core. SAP, while essential for the functionality of diapers, is challenging to recycle due to its synthetic nature and contamination with organic waste. However, I believe that by leveraging innovative recycling methods, it may be possible to significantly reduce the environmental burden of this material.

With India’s growing disposable diaper consumption and its associated waste challenges, I am looking to explore ways to create a sustainable and scalable solution for collecting, cleaning, and repurposing SAP from used diapers. The idea is to establish a recycling network in India that could contribute to a circular economy, reduce landfill waste, and explore potential new uses for the recycled SAP.

I am keen to explore how TerraCycle’s experience in waste management and expertise in recycling could help turn this concept into reality. I would be extremely grateful if you would consider a potential collaboration to:

Develop an innovative recycling process for SAP from diapers.
Implement a collection network for used diapers across India.
Investigate possible applications for recycled SAP in eco-friendly products or other sustainable solutions.
I believe that with your expertise and guidance, we can work towards making a real difference in India’s waste management system while contributing to global sustainability efforts.

Please let me know if you’d be open to a conversation about this idea. I’d be happy to discuss the concept in more detail and explore how we might collaborate.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing from you.

Warm regards,
